# EZJava Library (Easy Java Syntax)

This library's primary objective is to simplify Java's syntax by **eliminting boilerplate, and conducting tasks within one line**.


## Feature: Simplified Input Methods
Eliminated the need to create and manually validate input. Methods are built-in with input validation for data-type and overloaded to accept min-max ranges for all applicable datatypes (including Strings).

### Sample
<img width="3680" height="1720" alt="Input java (4)" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0c38f2e9-096d-483b-8a82-0412cbe27cdc" />


## Feature: Reading Boolean Input with Validation
You can use y/n, yes/no, AND true/false as boolean inputs. Java by default accepts only the "true" and "false" strings.

### Sample

## Feature: Colored Output & Typewriter Method (Works on Terminal-based IDEs or actual Terminals):
You can easily generate colored output (as of writing this: Red, Yellow, Green, Blue) and use the built in typewriter method, which takes two arguments:

1. String
2. Speed (Milliseconds)

### Sample:
