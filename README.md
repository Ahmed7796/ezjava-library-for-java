# EZJava Library (Easy Java Syntax)

This library's primary objective is to simplify Java's syntax by **eliminting boilerplate, and conducting tasks within one line**.


## Feature: Simplified Input Methods
Eliminated the need to create and manually validate input. Methods are built-in with input validation for data-type and overloaded to accept min-max ranges for all applicable datatypes (including Strings).

## Feature: Reading Boolean Input with Validation
You can use y/n, yes/no, AND true/false as boolean inputs. Java by default accepts only the "true" and "false" strings.
